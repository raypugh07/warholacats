  <meta name="description" content="Warhola Cats is an indie band from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Propelled by the writing of Elisabeth Gasparka, the group-- which includes Gasparka as vocalist along with Sarah Gail Luther, Jackie Mich and Alexander Cain-- composes lyrical pop songs created with voice, cello, piano, flute, percussion and guitar (among other instruments). Warhola Cats’ songs vary between poignancy and the absurd; in a live set’s worth of tracks you’ll find themes of longing, anticipation, existential dread, and heartfelt anthems toasting the Milwaukee mundane-- inviting reverence for this time and place, musical renderings to capture the moment as it passes.">
